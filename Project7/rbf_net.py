        Parameters:

        data: ndarray. shape=(num_samps, num_features). Data to learn / train on.

        TODO:
        - Determine `self.prototypes` (see constructor for shape). Prototypes are the centroids
        returned by K-means. It is recommended to use the 'batch' version of K-means to reduce the
        chance of getting poor initial centroids.
            - To increase the chance that you pick good centroids, set the parameter controlling the
            number of iterations > 1 (e.g. 5)
        - Determine self.sigmas as the average distance between each cluster center and data points
        that are assigned to it. Hint: You implemented a method to do this!

    def train(self, data, y):

        Parameters:
        -----------
        data: ndarray. shape=(num_samps, num_features). Data to learn / train on.
        y: ndarray. shape=(num_samps,). Corresponding class of each data sample.

        Goal: Set the weights between the hidden and output layer weights (self.wts) using
        linear regression. The regression is between the hidden layer activation (to the data) and
        the correct classes of each training sample. To solve for the weights going FROM all of the
        hidden units TO output unit c, recode the class vector `y` to 1s and 0s:
            1 if the class of a data sample in `y` is c
            0 if the class of a data sample in `y` is not c

        Notes:
        - Remember to initialize the network (set hidden unit prototypes and sigmas based on data).
        - Pay attention to the shape of self.wts in the constructor above. Yours needs to match.
        - The linear regression method handles the bias unit.

        ndarray of nonnegative ints. shape=(num_samps,). Predicted class of each data sample.

        TODO:
        - Pass the data thru the network (input layer -> hidden layer -> output layer).
        - For each data sample, the assigned class is the index of the output unit that produced the
