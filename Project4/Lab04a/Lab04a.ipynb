    "In this task, we will get familiar with the [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) module. The main data type in pandas is called a [DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/intro_tutorials/01_table_oriented.html#min-tut-01-tableoriented). Think of `DataFrame` as a direct replacement/substitute for your `Data` class. In fact, starting with Project 4, we will use pandas instead of your `Data` class. As you will soon see, you can easily convert back and forth between pandas DataFrame objects and NumPy ndarrays.\n",

    "4. Create a new DataFrame `df_prnt` which includes only the variables that involve percentages: `speeding`, `alcohol`, `not_distracted`, and `no_previous`.\n",
    "   1. Update `df_prnt` so that each variable is min-max normalized. This means subtracting the minimum and dividing by the extent so that each variable ranges from 0-1.\n",
