    "In this task, you will apply K-means to one image and to compress it (*image compression*). The idea is that you will find $k$ RGB color centroids in the image, then replace each pixel in the image with the nearest centroid. This will compress an image, by only using $k$ colors to represent it. You can also think of this as doing a simple image region segmentation: regions with similar colors will belong to the same cluster. It also makes some cool retro effects!"
