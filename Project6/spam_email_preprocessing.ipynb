    "\n",
    "Before you can build a spam email filter, you need to transform the email data into a suitable format so that KNN or other supervised learning algorithms can process them (this is called **preprocessing**).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will work with the **Enron email dataset**, a large dataset consisting of ~34,000 emails. Enron is an energy company that famously went bankrupt in the early 2000s after committing massive accounting fraud (more info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron). The US government seized company emails during their investigation and they were released to the public much later and nowadays is a commonly used dataset in machine learning. \n",
    "\n",

    "We need to turn each email's text into something an algorithm can process (**features**). We will use a simple type of feature: **bag of words counts**. That is, we will reduce an email into a vector of how many times words appeared in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Problem:* There are too many words across all the emails. Processing the counts in each email would take too long. For example, there are more than 40,000 words across all the emails. If we were trying to predict whether 1,000 emails are spam or not, we would need to build a `1000 x 40000` matrix (count each of the 40,000 words in each of the 1,000 emails), which would take a very long time to process by the supervised learning algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "A work-around that works quite well is to restrict ourselves to the most frequent $W$ words in the email dataset. You can experiment with how many words to include (e.g. as an extension), but for concreteness we will set this $W=200$ in the core project. In the above example, we can then process `1000 x 200` matrix much more quickly."
